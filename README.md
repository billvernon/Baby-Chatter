BabyChatter
===========

I developed this as a port of my "Baby's Talking" application for iOS.  The app is a diary that allows parents to keep track of their young children's new words as they say them.  I developed this project to learn .NET.  Currently, I lack an actual Windows Phone device to test on and I don't really want to purchase one right now so if someone wants to take over this project, feel free to do so.
